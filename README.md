# ETD (Encrypted Topic Discussion)

This web app allows a user to join a chat room in which other users are discussing a random topic of the day, by entering their username. Once they enter their username, it will be encrypted using the Caesar Cipher algorithm which will allow the user's identity to remain a secret. Once they enter their username, they will see the chat room and all the users currently online.
