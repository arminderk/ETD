# ETD (Encrypted Topic Discussion)

This is an experimental application which I developed to get a better understanding of node.js, socket.io, and encryption algorithms. A user must enter a username to join the dicussion. Once the user enters their username, it will be encrypted using the Caesar Cipher algorithm. This is done so that the user's identity remains a secret. The user can choose to decrypt their username by clicking a button, and doing so will allow all other users to see their decrypted username.
