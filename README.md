# ETD (Encrypted Topic Discussion)

This is an experimental application I developed to get a better understanding of node.js, socket.io, and encryption algorithms. A user must enter a username to join the dicussion. Once the user enters their username, it will be encrypted using the Caesar Cipher algorithm so that their real identity remains hidden. The user can choose to decrypt their username by clicking a button, and doing so will allow all other users to see their decrypted username.

Please feel free to try it out by clicking the link below!
