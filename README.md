# ETD (Encrypted Topic Discussion)

* This web app allows a user to join a chat room where users are discussing a random topic.

* A user must enter a username. If they don't, the app will not allow them to enter the chatroom.

* Once the user enters their username, it will be encrypted using the Caesar Cipher algorithm. This is done so that the user's identity remains a secret.

* The user can choose to decrypt their username by clicking a button. Doing so, will allow all other users to see their decrypted username.
