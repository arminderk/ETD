# ETD (Encrypted Topic Discussion)

This is an experimental application which I developed to get a better understanding of node.js, socket.io, and encryption algorithms. A user must enter a username. If they don't, the app will not allow them to enter the chatroom. Once the user enters their username, it will be encrypted using the Caesar Cipher algorithm. This is done so that the user's identity remains a secret. The user can choose to decrypt their username by clicking a button. Doing so, will allow all other users to see their decrypted username.
